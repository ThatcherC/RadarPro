# PALSAR Synthetic Aperature RADAR Processor

**TODO**
- [ ] add download instructions for PALSAR imagery
- [ ] add list of SAR jargon terms
- [ ] use just one big matrix, do operations in place, and save off small images at each stage instead of carrying around giant complex matrices from each stage of processing (`cimg`, `shiftedft`, ...)
